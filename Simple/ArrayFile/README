     CompBio::Simple::ArrayFile - provide access to a sequence
     file through an array

       # where format is as defined in CompBio::check_type

     This allows an input file of sequence data to be tied to the
     array returned by CompBio::Simple::_munge_seq_input. It
     provides a way to have all the processing code use one
     format without needing to read the whole file into memory.

     Please check your favorite perl reference for more
     information on the tie function.

     This tie module provides only three methods, the TIEARRAY
     (basically a new in OO syntax) to create the tied array,
     FETCH to read a sequence record from the file, and DESTROY
     which basically just closes the filehandle;

     Take a close look at whether or not the method for adding
     sequences should be developed.

     Consider ways to emulate array slices and specific index
     selects. Just added random member testing for check_type and
     I'm sure this will break when used there.
