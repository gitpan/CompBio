INSTALL intructions for CompBio modules, version .01

Edit the top level CompBio.pm module to have the apropriate settings for the exported globals.

shell> perl Makefile.PL

shell> make

shell> make test

And if all has gone well

shell> make install


TO DO:

add a configure script to handle editing the globals in CompBio.pm, or edit Makefile.pl to do so.
